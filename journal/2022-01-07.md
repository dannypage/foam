## General

@Elise is grabbing at things!

Starting to lose track of what day of the week it is, great sign

I think I need to finally sit down and sketch out what Deckle should be, because I keep looking at a code editor and freezing.

## Activities

- Elliptical, didn't go great

## Vibes

- Healthy

## To Do

- Facetime with Mom with Elise!
- Should buy a pill kit so I don't accidentally take two ADHD meds
- Email the NWSL CEO. Might not do anything, but hopefully the Spirit aren't bought by the assholes...

## Watched

- The Grand Tour: France. What a weird, weird, episode. They've always had some absurd moments, but this really leans into it.
