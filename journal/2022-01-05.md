## General

Another solo parent day went well. 

Getting tired of some games, like just straight up quitting a Heroes of the Storm game in the middle because there are better things to do with my time... Like check Twitter. (okay and do chores to be a good solo parent)

The garage is insulated after all, but not under the floors? So the cold air is not coming from the garage, but the in-between space between the two floors. Debating how to fix this.

Looks like the new attic insulation worked, the roof still looks good instead of melted. Which is good since it seems like it'll be a potentially more expensive winter, even if not necessarily colder.

## Activities

- Shopping at Target, bought Tron Vinyl and Samurai Champloo blu-rays.

## Vibes

- Headache, but no other symptoms.

## To Do

- Finally write out those reviews, due the 14th.

## Watching

Witcher S7E7
Might watch F1 2008, 2010, or 2012.
