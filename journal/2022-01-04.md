## General

Solo parent day with @Elise! Unlike the first one, a lot more fuss today. But was able to eventually power though it, let her fuss a bit and wake up, only for her to finally fall asleep for a longer period of time before @Nikki came home. The Snoo is a quality thing, glad we have it, helps her sleep.

Another 900k covid cases today, with kid admissions rising sharply. And people want to moan about how schools shouldn't be shut and teachers unions are awful. I'd be upset too if my kid was home with very little warning, but that's on the capital-G government not making it safe for teachers or compenstating them for their front-line duty. 2 years of this and that lesson hasn't sunk in. Truly frustrating.

## Activities

Made a Github action to automate creating this file when I need it. Also have a bash script that I can do whenever I finally move this to a different service. Improve 1% every day!

## Vibes

- Chill but tired. Parenting, turns out it's hard!

## To Do

- Buy LockTite to seal the holes in the house that are likely making the floors cold.

## Watching

- Witcher Season 2, half episode a night.
