## General

dems still ain't done shit about J6, but "commemorated" nonetheless. 

Witcher Season 2 was fantastic. I don't know if I'll ever play the games, but I definitely need to get the books now. Maybe in both languages!

@elise had her first major round of shots and slept a lot. Painful at first but she got through it. What a champ!

I really need to find a good library in Python that just automatically has all the get/update/create stuff for models. don't want to go into another project and have to write boilerplate

## Activities

- 2 month appointment! @Elise is 70 percentile for length, she may end up as tall as me?

## Vibes

- chill day, would like more sleep, but whatever throat thing i had is gone

## To Do

- setup the picture server
