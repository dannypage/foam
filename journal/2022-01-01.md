## General

@elise: Smiling a lot! Loves to look at fans and things that make shadows. Squirms while feeding, but always a joy. Almost swear she is trying to talk to us!

Starting to try, yet again, to get this journal going. New year new me, and all that. Time to really get organized these next few months. Lots of cruft to trim out as I clearly have less time these days!

@Nikki: Hi, I love you, and you're doing fantastic :)

## Activities

- Beard trim
- Ran 3 miles
- Cleaned podcast backlog
- Unsubscribing from all the emails

## Vibes

- Hangover from champagne
- Dry throat
- Both gone by evening, though lethargic

## To do

- Present for Kyrie
- California taxes
- Finally make a concrete plan for Deckle
- Same with Skrimmage
- I have way too many tabs, time to focus on two or three ideas and only collect stuff for that, otherwise it goes into a pile or trash.
