## General

400,000 covid cases per day over the last week, and yet still folks are packing into stores, some with no mask. January might be a nightmare.

@Elise still fuss while feeding. Time to go bottle only? But she had her first laughs today! Let her "hop" on my legs and she loved it. So glad we also got it on camera.

Hoping I win fantasy football, all comes down to Elrid getting a ton of points in one game. Would love to know how points are distributed in a game... could be interesting for DFS. - And if I don't win, that is fine. Got very lucky with matchups this year.

## Activities

- Financial balancing for December


## Vibes

- Dry throat again? hope not covid :|
- Sore from running. Hate this part 

## To do

- Thank Jeremy and Jennifer for the gift
