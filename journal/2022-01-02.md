## General

400,000 covid cases per day over the last week, and yet still folks are packing into stores, some with no mask. January might be a nightmare.

@Elise still fuss while feeding. Time to go bottle only?

## Activities

## Vibes

- Dry throat again? hope not covid :|
- Sore from running. Hate this part 

## To do

- Thank Jeremy and Jennifer for the gift
